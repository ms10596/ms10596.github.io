__Graduation Project:__

My graduation project is based on a popular NLP problem which is Text Readability Assessment. We aim in this project to classify any given text to one of 3 levels Easy, Intermediate and hard. We have done multiple experiments using different types of network architecture like LSTM and CNN using Keras framework and based on OneStopEnglish corpus.
