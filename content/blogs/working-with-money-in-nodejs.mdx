Working with money in JS can be a little tricky. Usually you need to do some simple math operations that sometimes can lead to unpredicted results as we know `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`. This is because computers do calculations in [Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://0.30000000000000004.com/). So by the end of this tutorial we should be able to do the below calculations on moneteral values correctly.

```shell
> 10.1 + 10.2
20.299999999999997
> 10.1 * 3
30.299999999999997
> 10 /3
3.3333333333333335
```

## We'll look on different ways to tackle this problem.

1. [Using JS only](#1-using-js-only)
2. [Using decimal.js](#2-using-decimaljs)
3. [Using DINERO.JS](#3-using-dinerojs)
4. [New operator allocate](#4-new-operator-allocate)
5. [Dealing with money in prisma](#5-dealing-with-money-in-prisma)

## 1. Using JS only.

This convert the problem from floating point arithmetic into integer arithmetic, Simply by doing the calculations on the smallest monetary unit. So if we're talking Egyptian Pounds we'll be doing calculation by converting the pound to piasters by multiplying it by 100 and then dividing by 100 again.

```js
const add = (a, b) => (a * 100 + b * 100) / 100;
const multiply = (amount, factor) => (amount * 100 * factor) / 100;
const divide = (amount, factor) => (amount * 100) / factor / 100;

add(10.1, 10.2); // 20.3
multiply(10.1, 3); // 30.3
divide(10, 3); // 3.333333333333333
```

Looks like we've made a good progress, addition and multiplication works fine but division does not look right.

## 2. Using decimal.js.

`decimal.js` has a great set of functions that can be used in dealing with money. It can be downloaded via `npm` from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/decimal.js).

```js
new Decimal(10.1).plus(10.2).toString(); // '20.3'
new Decimal(10.1).mul(3).toString(); // '30.3'
new Decimal(10).div(3).toString(); // '3.3333333333333333333'
```

So again we've solved the addtion and multiplication but we've failed in division.

## 3. Using DINERO.JS.

DINERO as the name suggests is made specifically for handling monetary values. It can be downloaded via `npm` from [here](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start). It comes with methods for creating, parsing, manipulating, testing, transforming and formatting monetary values. It takes also currency in consideration when doing operations.

```js
Dinero({ amount: 1010, currency: 'EGP' })
  .add(Dinero({ amount: 1020, currency: 'EGP' }))
  .toFormat(); // 'EGP 20.30'
Dinero({ amount: 1010, currency: 'EGP' }).multiply(3).toFormat(); // 'EGP 30.30'
Dinero({ amount: 1000, currency: 'EGP' }).divide(3).toFormat(); // 'EGP 3.33'
```

So as we see, we needed to multiply the amount by 100 to provide the smallest form of our currency. Now our results looks much better and we're having a good format.

### 4. New operator allocate.

In the above example we've seen that `10 / 3` can be equals to `EGP 3.33` which is right but not very right because the inverse of the operation will not be accurate.

```js
Dinero({ amount: 1000, currency: 'EGP' }).divide(3).multiply(3).toFormat(); // 'EGP 9.99'
```

As we can see `10 != 9.99`, Although the difference is small but it's not acceptable in sectors such as banking. An `EGP 100` loan over 3 months with no interest will make the bank lose as the total principal that will be paid is `EGP 99.99` instead of `EGP 100`.

> In that case you might need [`allocate`](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/api/mutations/allocate).

```js
Dinero({ amount: 1000, currency: 'EGP' })
  .allocate([1, 1, 1])
  .map((row) => row.toFormat());
// ['EGP 3.34', 'EGP 3.33', 'EGP 3.33']
```

Now that's makes much more sense. If we add those numbers we can get the original amount. Notice that `allocate` takes an array of integers as argument. This array represent the ratio and the array length represents the value that we want to distribute the amount on evenly.

## 5. Dealing with money in prisma.

Majority of databases will support `Decimal` as a data type. In postgresql there's a dedicated type for money.

```prisma
model Item {
    id       Int     @id
    price    Decimal @db.money
    currency String
}
```

After migration Typescript will understand that creating an item will expect price of be a `Decimal`, `DecimalJsLike`, `number` or `string`. Also `prisma` uses `decimal.js` to represent the decimal value from the database.

```ts
export type ItemCreateInput = {
  id: nmber;
  price: Decimal | DecimalJsLike | number | string;
  currency: string;
};
```

## Conclusion.

In this tutorial I've explained how I've dealt with moneteral values in NodeJS. I thought that `Double` or `Float` can be used but I was so wrong and I've did large refactors and replace them with the right types. I'm glad that I've found great resources that guided me to the right way.
