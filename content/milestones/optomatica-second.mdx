- Developed REST APIs using Typescript, Nestjs, and Prisma following the OpenAPI specifications. I also did a lot of unit testing with Jest.
- Developed large React Apps that consume the above APIs. I always try to use the latest widely adopted open-source packages for data fetching, state management, and form handling. I tend to create custom hooks a lot also.
- Worked on creating a full loan management system from the ground for one of the biggest startups for SME financing in Egypt.
- I've developed an internal tool that automated a task related to GPX processing that involves multiple parties. It has decreased the time taken from a few hours to 2 seconds.
- Created an end-to-end type-safe full-stack web app that leverages the power of graphql, typescript, and turborepo.
- Worked on developing [AlMohaseb ERP desktop app.](https://almohaseb-erp.com/). It's a cross-platform desktop app built with Electron, React, RTK Query, React-hook-form, and Material UI.
- Contributed to many open-source projects but my greatest one was with [Genie.jl docs](https://github.com/GenieFramework/GenieFrameworkDocs)
- Became an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/a74e80fc-707c-41a7-8769-83e6d6452e14/public_url).
- Earned the [Advent of Typescript 2023 Platinum](https://typehero.dev/@ms10596) badge.
- Lately I'm doing code reviews and merge pull requests for my fellow junior software developers.
