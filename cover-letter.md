Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Software Engineer position at your company. I believe that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this role. I started my career as a Data Scientist, I was focused in NLP. I worked with transformer based models, Back then they were the state of the art. I've also worked with classical machine learning and NLP. Being a data scientist has exposed me to work with different tools and technologies. I used to make dashboards on google data studio and **BigQuery**.

Afterwards I started shifting towards backend. I worked with **FastAPI** on developing image similarity app that uses Amazon Rekognition to match faces. Talking about **Python** I spent some time mentoring students with Udacity, I was explaining backend with Flask. I started exploring **React** and Node. Currently Typescript is the best tool I'm using right now. I'm always trying to maintain typesafety between backend and frontend. I've used **NextJS** in [my personal website. Feel free to visit, I've published some blogs there.](https://ms10596.github.io) I'm using **Tailwindcss** also there.

Lately I was involved in a project that uses **RAG**. It's a chatbot that's tailored to whatever document you supply it. It uses pinecone as a **vector store**, chatgpt API and **langchain**. We've used **NestJS**, Apollo GraphQL and Prisma. We did a lot of **unit testing, mocking and e2e testing**.

I believe that I can be a great addition to your team. I'm aware that I need to always learn new things to stay relevant in the industry. I'm always trying to learn new things. I'm a team player and I'm always trying to help my teammates. Lately I'm doing code reviews and merge pull requests for my fellow junior software developers.

I do really appreciate if can setup a meeting to discuss my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
