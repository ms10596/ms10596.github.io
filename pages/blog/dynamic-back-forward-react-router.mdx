export default () => {
  const navigationType = useNavigationType();
  const location = useLocation();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  const [routesLength, setRoutesLength] = useState(0);

  const goBack = () => {
    setCurrentIndex(currentIndex - 1);
    navigate(-1);
  };

  const goForward = () => {
    setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
    navigate(1);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (navigationType === 'PUSH') {
      let newLength = routesLength + 1;
      setRoutesLength(newLength);
      setCurrentIndex(newLength);
    }
  }, [location, navigationType]);

  return {
    canBack: currentIndex > 0,
    canForward: currentIndex < routesLength,
    goForward,
    goBack,
